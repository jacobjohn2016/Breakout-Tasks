Good place to take family and to go with friends for some good conversation. They are serving really awsome food with very quick pace. 
But, if you are taking more than 10 people at a time , it will be difficult to find a place to accommodate everyone around the same table. 
They do not have a dedicated parking space. But you can avail the pay and park option available very next to this place 
Porotta and beef fry is my fav food here ☺️",1576429279,2019-12-15 22:31:19+05:30
