They are serving really awsome food with very quick pace. \nBut, if you are taking more than 10 people at a time , it will be difficult to find a place to accommodate everyone around the same table. \nThey do not have a dedicated parking space. But you can avail the pay and park option available very next to this place \nPorotta and beef fry is my fav food here \u263a\ufe0f",
